### Requirements

- [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started) or higher.

### ~~Building~~

**This section is severely outdated.**

Create a file named `appsecrets.json` alongside `appsettings.json`. This file was intentionally omitted from source control. Then paste the following code, replacing the token string with your own.

```json
{
  "discord": {
    "token": "..."
  }
}
```

Then run the following commands:

1. `dotnet restore` — resolves NuGet dependencies.
2. `dotnet build` — builds the bot.
3. `dotnet run` — runs the bot.
